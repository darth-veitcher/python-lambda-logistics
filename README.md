# Python Lambda Logistics
The Python Lambda Logistics (`pll`) library is designed to assist with an automated deployment for `Python 3` AWS Lambda functions.

As you will no doubt discover, as soon as you require more than the basic libraries, you need to start creating what 
are known as 'deployment packages' (zip files with all dependencies) for pushing even basic scripts up to AWS.

These packages require that the libraries are compiled for amazon's version of linux (which is executing the code on 
your behalf).

Not helpful if your development machine isn't running AWS Linux...

## Underlying Process
`pll` aims to simplify the above by automating the build of your `requirements.txt` file in a `Docker` image of 
`awslinux`.

1. Create working directories in your current project
    * `Build`  --  contains compiled `site-packages` for future re-use
    * `Dist`  --  outputted lambda `zip` for upload to AWS
2. Check for a local docker image of `saracen9/python-lambda` or pull down
3. Mount the following locations into the docker image
    * `Build` --> /tmp/app/psite-packages
    * `Dist` --> /tmp/app/zipped-package
    * YourAppplicationRoot --> /app
4. Run the container and compile
5. Shutdown and Â£profit

The original Dockerfile used to create the image is contained within the package source code for those who want to hack 
their own.

## Usage
```bash
docker run --rm --name py-lamb-compiler \
    -v ~/my/app:/app \
    -v ~/my/app/dist:/tmp/app/dist \
    -v ~/my/app/build:/tmp/app/build \
    saracen9/python-lambda
```
